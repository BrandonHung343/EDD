3/13/17 Have to figure out the basic skeletal pseudocode

Format should look like this:

dict = {num1:{'x':xOne, 'y': yOne}, etc.}
while True:
	int code = RFID.scan()
	for k, v in dict.items():
		if code = k:
			getXPos(v, code)
			getYPos(v, code)
			screwActuator.setPos(xPos, yPos)


def getXPos(list, idNum):
	xPos = list.get('x', 0)
	return xPos



def getYPos(list, idNum):
	yPos = list.get('y', 1)
	return yPos
3/15/17
-Got RFID ID reading to work
-Use the test3 file to scan for individual numbers
-Record IDnums tomorrow
-Unplug wire from RX before uploading
-Strings of 27 numbers are produced by tag
-First module wasn't working right, so switched out and second worked fine

3/16/17
-Make sure to upload to repo at home
-Uploaded txt files to drive before leaving
-Bring Rpi for tomorrow
-Figure out where to salvage steppers 
-Got some new code for RPI, test RFID reading
